## Description
This project creates a professional README.md file straight from your terminal. All a user has to do is run "node index.js" and they will be prompted with questions. The responses are then generated in the back end. They will be formatted in a way that looks like the markdown file was made from scratch. There is a section for each necessary aspect of a project such as usage, contributions guidelines, contact me, and installation info.
